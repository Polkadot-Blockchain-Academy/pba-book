# Substrate

Total time required 2.5 days.

## Lesson Preparation

This module consists of a combination of lectures, activities, and sections of the accompanying exercises to to students at what time.
As there is a large amount of variance in student experience around Substrate, we want to make sure that we have a variety of content for students of different experience levels.

### Graded Assignment

> **All graded assignments and solutions must remain private to the Academy staff, faculty, and enrolled students!**

There is a private to the Academy graded exercise, in a _template repository_ titled `frameless-node-template--master` that should be introduced after the first lectures are complete.
Instructors should create a per cohort, **private**, derived from the master copy, make it a template repo, and configure the cohort Github Classroom to use this new repo as an assignment.

The "`px...` assignment problem" sections indicates that students are now capable of completing them with the content so far covered.
They should be encouraged to start working on them as time allows _outside of class time!_
They should not zone-out of class to complete this during class time, they should prioritize in-class activities and exercises over working on the assignment!

### Exercises and Activities

There is a private to the Academy graded exercise, in a _template repository_ titled `pba-wasm-executor--master` that should be introduced after the first lectures are complete.
Instructors should create a per cohort, **write-access granted to the cohort team**, derived from the master copy, make it a template repo, instruct students to use the `<github username/*` branch namespace for any of their work, with `<github username>` acting as their `main` branch.
Ensure the `main` branch is write protected, by required a PR first`- no one should be able to push to`main`!
