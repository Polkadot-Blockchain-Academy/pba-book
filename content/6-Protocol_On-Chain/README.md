## Cross Consensus Messaging (XCM)

<!-- TODO Break down the following in the schedule below -->
Day 1:

- Intro to XCM
- Most Important XCM Scenarios (reserve transfer, teleport transfer, governance, upgrades, transact)
- XCM Instructions (and specifically how these instructions map to these most important scenarios)
- XCM Executor (dive into the logic of how instructions are executed and all the base types surrounding the executor)
- Workshop: Build and test all of the important end to end scenarios with XCM simulator

Goal: avoid talking about or touching the XCM config at all at this point. Just make them work with the base tools needed to build an XCM.

Day 2:

- XCM Config
- Workshop: Modify XCM Simulator with some custom configurations and write end to end tests
- XCMP, HRMP, UMP, Connections, Queues
- XCM Version
- Zombienet, and setting up a local environment
- Workshop: building end to end XCM on a live test net using either JavaScript or Rust as a CLI or Front-End
- EXTRA: XCM specific scenario for polkadot-sdk project they work on

Goal, finally expose users to all that they can configure, have them make configurations for different scenarios and test they work.

### Learning Outcomes

Goal for Day 1: Building an example end to end XCM Simulator
Goal for Day 2: Building an example end to end with JavaScript / Rust front end / CLI
