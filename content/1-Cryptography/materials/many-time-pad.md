# Activity: Crack the Many Time Pad

> Instructors: there is a **_private guide_** associated with this activity to assist with hints and further details, be sure to review this before starting.

## Introduction

The symmetric [one-time pad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_pad#Example) is known to be secure when the key is only used once.
In practice key distribution is not always practical, and users sometimes make the critical mistake of reusing a pre-shared key.

In this activity, you will experience first hand why reusing the key is detrimental to security.

## The Challenge

The following several ciphertexts were intercepted on a peer-to-peer communication channel:

- Messages definitively originate in the USA, destined for the UK.
- Each line contains one hex encoded message, in it's entirety.
- We believe all messages were encrypted with the same key.

Your task is to use [cryptanalysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptanalysis) to recover the plaintexts of all messages, as well as the encryption key used for them.

## Instructions

1. Team up with 2-4 students to complete this activity.
1. Briefly inspect the ciphertext to see if you can identify patterns that may hint some things about their origin.
1. Research based on what we know bout the messages to find clues to help come up with a theory and game plan to complete your task.
1. Write a program in Rust that finds the key to generate the plaintext from the provided cipher texts.<br />
   The general steps are:

   1. Find the length of the longest input cipher text.
   1. Generate a key of that length.
   1. Find what the correct key is...

Note that this task is _intended_ to be a bit vague, give it your best effort.
We will be sharing hints as time progresses for everyone.
Don't hesitate to ask for support if you're feeling stuck, or just ask your peers!

## Finished?

**Once complete, let a faculty know!**

One last ciphertext using the same key that should prove tricky:

```text
1f3cb1f3e01f3fd1f3ea1f3e61f3e01f3e71f3b31f3a91f3c81f3a91f3f91f3fc1f3fb1f3ec1f3e51f3f01f3a91f3f91f3ec1f3ec526e1b014a020411074c17111b1c071c4e4f0146430d0d08131d1d010707040017091648461e1d0618444f074c010e19594f0f1f1a07024e1d041719164e1c1652114f411645541b004e244f080213010c004c3b4c0911040e480e070b00310213101c4d0d4e00360b4f151a005253184913040e115454084f010f114554111d1a550f0d520401461f3e01f3e71f3e81f3e71f3ea1f3e01f3e81f3e51f3a91f3e01f3e71f3fa1f3fd1f3e01f3fd1f3fc1f3fd1f3e01f3e61f3e71f3a7
```

Notice a pattern? why might that be... ðŸ¤”

If you want more to do, find ways to improve your solution, perhaps:

- Create a tool that automates the cipher key generation.
- Add a way to generate new cipher texts.
- Create your own cipher texts using other cipher methods.
- Provide a new set of ciphertexts that were intentionally constructed not to use the most common English words.
