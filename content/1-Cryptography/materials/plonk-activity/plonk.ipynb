    "Secondly we can encrypt variables such that you don't need to know them to compute with them. So what I can do is take g_2 and share that with someone. Everyone can then calculate g_1 time g_2 but they will never know what secret_2 is. That is what we need to do here. So during our trusted setup we calculate `g_2` which is a `g_2` generator times a secret and once we throw away the secret there is not way to find the secret again. \n",
