# Hash Based Data Structures

---

## Comparison to<br />Pointer Based Data Structures

- A hash references the<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0" --> **content**<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0" --> of some data;<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0" -->
- A pointer tells you where to find it;<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
- We can not have cycles of hashes.<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->

---

## Hash Chains

<img style="width: 800px" src="./img/Hash-Chains.png" />

A hash chain is a linked list using hashes to connect nodes.

Notes:

Each block has the hash of the previous one.

---

## Merkle Trees

<img style="width: 800px" src="./img/Merkle-tree-all-purple.png" />

A binary Merkle tree is a binary tree using hashes to connect nodes.

---

## Proofs

<ul>
<li class="fragment">The root or head hash is a commitment to the entire data structure.</li>
<li class="fragment">Generate a proof by expanding some but not all hashes.</li>
<li class="fragment"><i>Crucial for the trustless nature of decentralised cryptographic data systems!</i></li>
</ul>

---

## Proofs: Merkle Copaths

<img style="width: 800px" src="./img/Merkle-Copaths.png" />

Notes:

Given the children of a node, we can compute a node
Given the purple nodes and the white leaf, we can compute the white nodes bottom to top.
If we compute the correct root, this proves that the leaf was in the tree

---

## Security

- Collision resistance: we reasonably assume only one preimage for each hash,<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0" -->
- therefore making the data structure's linkage persistent and enduring<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
- (until the cryptography becomes compromised ðŸ˜¥).<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->

Notes:

Explain what could happen when this fails.

---

## Proof Sizes

Proof of a leaf has size $O(\log n)$<br />and so do proofs of updates of a leaf

---

## Key-Value Databases and Tries

---

## Key-value database

The data structure stores a map `key -> value`.<br />
We should be able to:

<pba-flex center>

- `put(key, value)`<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
- `get(key)`<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- `delete(key)`<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->

</pba-flex>

---

## Provability in key-value databases

We should also be able to perform the following operations for a provable key-value database:

1. For any key, if <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" --> `<key,value>`<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" --> is in the database, we can prove it.<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
1. If no value is associated to a key, we need to be able to prove that as well.<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->

## Types of Data Structures

- _**Trees**_ are rooted, directed acyclic graphs where each child has only one parent.
- _**Merkle Trees**_ are _trees_ which use hashes as links.
- _**Tries**_ are a particular class of _trees_ where:
  - Given a particular piece of data, it will always be on a particular path.
- _**Radix Tries**_ are a particular class of a trie where:
  - The location of a value is determined the path constructed one chunk of digits (represented in the chosen radix) at a time.
  - are optimized to ensure lonely node-paths are consolidated into a single node.
- _**Patricia Tries**_ are _radix-2 tries_

Notes:

Just a selection we'll cover in this course.

---

## Trie

_Words:_ to, tea, ted, ten, inn, A.

<img style="width: 800px" src="./img/Trie.png" />

Each node splits on the next digit in base $r$

Notes:

In this image, $r$ is 52 (26 lowercase + 26 uppercase).

---

## Radix Trie

_Words:_ to, tea, ted, ten, inn, A.

<img style="width: 700px" src="./img/Patricia-Trie.png" />

If only one option for a sequence we merge them.

<!-- TODO maybe some code stuff with extension nodes etc. -->

---

## Radix Trie Structures

```rust
pub enum Node {
  Leaf {
    partial_path: Slice<RADIX>,
    value: Value
  },
  Branch {
    partial_path: Slice<RADIX>,
    children: [Option<Hash>; RADIX],
    value: Option<Value>,
  },
}
```

Notes:

The old implementation actually made use of dedicated "extension" nodes instead of branch nodes that hold a partial path. There's a good explanation of them [here](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/39915/ethereum-merkle-patricia-trie-extension-node).

Additionally, if the size of a value is particularly large, it is replaced with the hash of its value.

<!-- TODO: Add a nice illustration similar to Shawn's dev-trie-backend-walk here. -->

---

## Hash Trie

- Inserting arbitrary (or worse, user-determined) keys into the Radix/Patricia tree can lead to highly unbalanced branches, enlarging proof-sizes and lookup times.<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
- Solution: pre-hash the data before inserting it to make keys random.<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- Resistance against partial collision is important.<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
- Could be a Merkle trie or regular.<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->

Notes:

- Q: Why would pre-hashing the data make the keys random? A: Because each piece of data should be unique! it is a good selection scheme.

## Computational and Storage <br />Trade-offs

What radix $r$ is best?

- Proof size of a leaf is $r \log_r n$
  - $r=2$ gives the smallest proof for one leaf

...but:

- Higher branching at high levels of the tree can give smaller batch proofs. <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0" -->
- For storage, it is best to read consecutive data so high $r$ is better. <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

Notes:
Q: Why would higher branching at high levels of the tree give smaller batch proofs?
A: Less nodes are needed in order to prove various parts of the tree

## Merkle Mountain Ranges

- Efficient proofs and updates for a hash chain
- Append only data structure
- Lookup elements by number

---

## Merkle Mountain Ranges

<img style="width: 800px" src="./img/U-MMR-13.png" />

Notes:

we have several Merkle trees of sizes that are powers of two.
The trees that are here correspond to the binary digits of 13 that are 1.

Notes:

- Not as balanced as a binary tree but close
- Can update the peak nodes alone on-chain

Applications:

- Stateless Client can very efficiently prove the end parts of the tree allowing for a client which doesnt need to store the whole blockchain just a few latest nodes.
- Look at the structure if each leaf is a block then if previous stuff is pruned that is fine because you still carry around the hash or peak of a selection of blocks
- Lightclients, efficiently see whether a transaction is included in a block without needing the entire the entire blockchain history
  We use this in polkadot for our bridging!!
