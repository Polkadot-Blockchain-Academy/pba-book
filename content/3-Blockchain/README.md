# Module 3: Blockchain Fundamentals

#### Prerequisites:

Latest stable rust compiler. You can install [the entire substrate developer environment](https://docs.substrate.io/install/).

## Learning Outcomes

This module introduces students to the shortcomings of centralized infrastructure including censorship, equity, reliability, and trustworthiness. It then demonstrates through lectures, coding activities, and games, how a peer to peer network can achieve consensus on a shared history that is recorded in the blockchain data structure.

The module is designed to 3 days of contact time lasting about 6-8 hours each day. Some out-of-class study is expected, and a graded assignment is recommended.

## Learning Outcomes

- Students will understand the goals of decentralized systems, the tradeoffs made to achieve those goals, and the place for centralized alternatives.
- Understand the importance of agreeing on history to agree on a notion of a present state.
- Students will understand the fundamentals of distributed consensus.
- Students will understand the blockchain datastructure, why each piece of data is in it, and how it tracks the history of a shared state machine.
- Students will be able to start a blockchain on their own.
- Students will be able to write blockchain related code.
- Students will be able to demonstrate how the grandpa finality gadget works.
- Students will understand how to grandpa finality gadget work.

## Hands on Activities

- The primary coding activity is [Blockchain From Scratch](https://github.com/JoshOrndorff/blockchain-from-scratch/). Each student should close this repository to work through it in and after class. This will occupy 8-10 hours of class time.

- Grandpa Board Game - TODO find the repo, it may have gotten deleted.

- Start a Blockchain and Fork Off - This activity is written up in [its own repo](https://github.com/Polkadot-Blockchain-Academy/Academy-PoW).
