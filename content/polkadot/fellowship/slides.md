# Polkadot Fellowship

## Prelude: Decentralization

- Decentralization can come in many fashions.
- Some of my (somewhat) personal opinions.. 💭

---v

### Prelude: Decentralization

#### 1. Technical 🔐

- Can the software be executed in a decentralized manner?

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

- Can multiple nodes actually run the software and come to consensus?

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Notes:

- Nakatomo coefficient
- Most blockchain systems actually already have this.

---v

### Prelude: Decentralization

#### 2. Operational ⚙️

- The software is capable of running in a decentralized manner. But is it actually?
  <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
  - Intermediaries, gateways, pools.
  <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Is the right "software" being executed by node operators?

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Notes:

- Metamask
- Mining/Staking Pool getting to large.

- **Node operators** are a concept here. They have the duty to run the "correct software". But how
  they come to this decision is something that needs knowledge, which brings us to the next point.

### Prelude: Decentralization

#### 3. Intellectual 🧠

- How many people know the existing protocol well enough to understand it.

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

- Which subset of these people make decisions about the future?

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

- Important to remember that node operators are usually in neither.

Notes:

1. the cathedral and bazaar
1. the papal model

### Prelude: Decentralization

#### 3. Intellectual 🧠

> My trust in Polkadot’s credible future should not rely on knowing that Parity, Gav or Shawn will
> continue to act benevolently.

- This is where a meta-protocol, and rule-based upgrade systems becomes important.

Notes:

Recall how if the governance of the chain decide to upgrade to protocol, node-operators don't have a
say in that by default.

This is taking away the "power of default" to be in the hands of the token holders, not the
node-operators.

---v

### Prelude: Decentralization

#### Geopolitical 🌎

- How many of protocol experts/node operators are under the same juristiction?

---

## The Fellowship

The fellowship is a **_technical decision making body_** onchain, aimed at alleviating the above
facades of centralization, but more so than anything else, the intellectual aspect.

Notes:

- Technical, high focus on core protocol aspects for now.
- decision-making: not saying it has absolute power yet.

---v

## The Fellowship

- Imperfect, not for everyone, opinionated 🥲!
- Strictly better than not taking an action.

Notes:

It is an _attempt_ at solving the issue. We believe it is strictly better than defining no rule
around it and letting it be as-is, but it might be sub-optimal.

> The Polkadot Fellowship aims to be one example of such an explicit action. The Fellowship is a
> rules-based social organisation with several aims centred around the support and recognition of
> the technical expertise needed for technical stability, security and progress of the network.

## The Fellowship Lifecycle

1. Initial seed

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

1. Entry

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

1. Promotion

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

1. Continuation

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

1. Gradual demote every 3-6 months.

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---v

### The Fellowship Lifecycle: Evaluation

> Evaluation is subjective, based on merits of "core blockchain engineering".

The manifesto provides one such example

1. API and code design.
1. Code contribution.
1. Social interactions.
1. Voting.

- Activity
- Agreement.

## Dan 0: The Candidate

- No requirement, no implication
- Deposit held for storage usage etc.

---

## Dan I: The Humble

- The (potentially) softest of the materials
- Wide range of hardness (1-3 Moh)
- Shares the exact same chemical composition as the material of the highest rank Grand Master—the hardest material—symbolizing the individual’s potential to go all the
  way.

---v

## Dan I: The Humble

- Clear aspiration to learn and evangelize the protocol.
- Deep knowledge at least one key component.
- Independent, vision-driven contribution.
- Being available and playing a crucial operational role for a network fix.

---

## Dan II: The Proficient

- ~1 Year of experience passed since acquiring Dan I.
- Responsible for research, analysis and implementation of a key component of the system.
- Potentially "on-call" for the same component.
- At least one published long-form semi-technical article concerning Polkadot.

---

## Fellowship: Kusama

- Used in conjuncture with `pallet-whitelist` and `pallet-preimage`.
- The fellowship can whitelist certain pre-images, which in turn can lead to faster execution.
- End of the day, it is all (virtual) runtime origins:
  - `Fellows`,
  - `Fellowship3Dan`,
  - `WhitelistedCaller`
  - ...

---

## Fellowship: The Near Future

- Payroll
- Delegation
- Runtimes moved to the fellowship repository
