# Course Materials Book

This book is the home of the majority of materials used within the Core Developer Track of the [Polkadot Blockchain Academy](https://dot.li/pba-github).

## Read the Book

We suggest the [online](#hosted-online) version for general use, but cloning, installing, and building this book [offline](#build-offline) is a great option on-the-go.

### Hosted Online

The latest version is hosted at: <a target="_blank" href="https://polkadot-blockchain-academy.github.io/pba-book/">https://polkadot-blockchain-academy.github.io/pba-book/</a>

### Build Offline

The Core Developer Track of the Academy is Rust _heavy_ and as such, you need to [install rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) before you can continue.

In order to `make` your life easy 😉, there is a set of tasks that use [`cargo make`](https://sagiegurari.github.io/cargo-make/#overview).

With [`cargo make`](https://sagiegurari.github.io/cargo-make/#installation) installed, you can list all tasks included to facilitate further installation, building, serving, formatting, and more with:

```sh
# Run from the top-level working dir of this repo
makers --list-all-steps
```

The tasks should be self-explanatory, if they are not - please file an issue to help us make them better.
