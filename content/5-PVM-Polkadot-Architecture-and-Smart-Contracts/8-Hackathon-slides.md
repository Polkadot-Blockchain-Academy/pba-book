# Contracts Competition

A half-day hackathon where students build hands on experience interacting with smart contracts on Polkadot.

---

## Goal

That was a lot of theory! Too much to take in at once.

- This hackathon will help everyone strengthening their understanding of the Polkadot Hub architecture.
- Explore possibilities and limitations of Polkadots brand new contracts stack.
- apply the knowledge from the theoretical part and gain hands-on experience with PVM contracts on Polkadot.

---

## Conditions

Teams of up to 3 people (can also work alone).
Pick an exciting project idea, start researching on it and even start developeing some PoC code.

- Your project needs to be connected to PVM contracts on Polkadot.
  This doesn't necessarily mean that you'll have to write and deploy a dApp (see inspiration ideas below).
- The project needs to have a business case behind (a way to generate revenue off of it).
- You are working on a new idea; any submitted work must be developed during the hackathon exclusively.
- You will submit the following:
  - Short project description
  - Any research done and conclusions found
  - Some PoC code (doesn't need to be much more than template code but you should get hands on)

## Example Project Ideas

- Anonymous voting for openGov
- Liquid staking protocols
- Oracle protocol with economic security mechanisms
- New Smart contract language targeting PVM
- Generative art platform with on-chain algorithms fully on-chain.
- A dex router across parachains
- DAO with anonymous voting (ZK proofing participation)
- STARK verifier contract (for example risc0)
- Smart contract fuzzer
- Formal verification framework for PVM contracts
- Flashloans a la https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3156
- A fun on-chain game to teach contracts (example https://github.com/use-ink/ink-workshop)
- pump.fun style coin casino with bonding curves (please consider ethical and legal aspects of gambling)

## Timeline

TODO: should be more fine grained

- introduction ideally in the morning so over lunch they can already think about ideas and team forming
- hackathon in the afternoon
- selection of winners and presentation at the end
