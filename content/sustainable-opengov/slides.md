# Sustainable OpenGov Participation

---

## Introduction

<pba-flex center>

- OpenGov depends on active, informed participation
- Many of its systems rely heavily on unpaid volunteer work
- This creates tension between ecosystem support and personal sustainability
- We'll examine real case studies that reveal problematic patterns
- And explore frameworks for sustainable participation models

</pba-flex>

---

## Unsustainable Patterns

<pba-flex center>

Common patterns that undermine OpenGov participation:

1. Uncompensated specialized expertise
2. Legal risk without protection
3. Retroactive/discretionary compensation
4. Administrative overhead exceeding value
5. Inconsistent valuation of similar work

</pba-flex>

## Case Study 1

### Polkadot Decentralized Voices OpenGov Proposal Reviews

---

### Background

<pba-flex center>

Decentralized Voices relies on community members to provide detailed proposal analysis

- Requires specialized technical and economic knowledge
- Legal understanding and risk assessment
- Significant time investment for quality reviews
- Carries potential liability exposure

</pba-flex>

---

### Challenge

<pba-flex center>

- Contributors providing detailed reviews without compensation structure
- Legal risk if project fails or funds are misallocated
- Time spent on reviews without predefined compensation structures may affect overall contributor workload
- May create challenging incentives for broader participation

</pba-flex>

---

### Outcomes

<pba-flex center>

- Varied levels of participation in OpenGov review over time
- Some qualified and experienced contributors finding it challenging to maintain involvement
- Opportunity to increase informed participation on important proposals
- Potential OpenGov deterioration over time and for system evolution to address these challenges

</pba-flex>

---

### Lessons Learned

<pba-flex center>

- Recognition of specialized expertise may help foster sustainable participation
- Legal protection frameworks could encourage more open communication
- Predictable compensation models rather than retroactive or discretionary compensation tend to reduce uncertainty for contributors
- Long-term engagement benefits from appropriate recognition of value

</pba-flex>

---

## Case Study 2

### Polkadot Ambassador Fellowship Program

---

### Background

<pba-flex center>

- Established to recognize community volunteers with discretionary bonuses
- Participants completed substantial work first
- Expectation of potential retroactive compensation
- Approval through OpenGov vote after completion

</pba-flex>

---

### Challenge

<pba-flex center>

- Discretionary OpenGov vote on compensation after work completed
- Significant upfront effort with no guarantee of payment
- Contributors must both complete work and advocate for payment
- Political factors impact compensation decisions

</pba-flex>

---

### Outcomes

<pba-flex center>

- Some contributors experienced challenges with compensation despite completing requested work
- In some instances, work quality recognition and payment approval followed different paths
- These experiences highlighted opportunities to improve clarity around contribution expectations
- Provided insights for developing more sustainable participation frameworks

</pba-flex>

---

### Lessons Learned

<pba-flex center>

- Retroactive compensation models can introduce uncertainty for contributors
- OpenGov decisions on payment involve multiple stakeholder considerations
- Contributors may need to balance both work effort and result communication
- These dynamics present opportunities to evolve participation frameworks

</pba-flex>

---

## Case Study 3

### Polkadot AMI Bounty Program

---

### Background

<pba-flex center>

- Administrative setup work with written agreements
- Explicit compensation terms for curator onboarding
- Hourly administrative tasks with documented rates
- Formal approval process through treasury

</pba-flex>

---

### Challenge

<pba-flex center>

- Even with explicit written agreements, divergent interpretations emerged
- Created opportunities to clarify financial documentation standards
- Administrative overhead to secure compensation required attention from multiple stakeholders
- Highlighted that even with clear communication in ecosystem mechanisms, trust may be undermined

</pba-flex>

---

### Outcome

<pba-flex center>

- Revealed that formal agreements face retroactive challenges and benefit from additional clarity mechanisms
- Highlighted the importance of consistency in compensation frameworks to avoid damaging contributor trust in compensation reliability
- Created precedent that formality alone may not address all communication needs and reduce compensation uncertainty
- Informed perspectives on willingness and sustainability of future contributions

</pba-flex>

---

### Lessons Learned

<pba-flex center>

- Clear agreements benefit from consistent interpretation standards since they may face retroactive challenges
- Streamlining administrative processes can preserve value for all parties to mitigate the risk of administrative overhead exceeding compensation value
- Ecosystem reliability and sustainability flourishes when expectations align across stakeholders that honor agreements
- Trust-building requires ongoing attention and care from all participants since once trust is broken, it is very difficult to rebuild

</pba-flex>

## Sustainable Framework Components

<pba-flex center>

Requirements for sustainable OpenGov participation:

1. Upfront funding through OpenGov **prior to** work commencement
2. Clear scope and compensation established before work begins
3. Legal protections through pre-approved budget allocations
4. Recognition of specialized expertise through fair compensation
5. Pooled insurance resources for all ecosystem contributors
6. Minimized administrative overhead for contributors

</pba-flex>

---

## Pre-Funded OpenGov Review Model

<pba-flex center>

Key elements of a sustainable model:

- OpenGov decision with sufficient notice (10+ working days)
- Clear caps on proposal quantities with priority order
- Maximum budget of hours and appropriate hourly rate
- Team rotation flexibility for resource management
- CPI adjustments for long-term arrangements
- Legal protections for reviewers through formal agreements
- Access to pooled professional insurance resources

</pba-flex>

---

## Pooled Insurance Resources

<pba-flex center>

Ecosystem-wide insurance coverage for contributors:

- **Professional Indemnity Insurance**: For proposal reviewers providing professional opinions
- **Public & Product Liability Insurance**: For organizers of physical pop-ups, events, and activities
- **Treasury-Funded Coverage**: Treasury funded rather than funding being an individual responsibility
- **Coverage Across Contributor Types**:
  - Decentralized Voices proposal assessments
  - Treasury bounty curator evaluations
  - Polkadot Ambassador Fellowship physical pop-ups, events, and activities
- **Cost Efficiency**: Pool resources to make insurance financially viable

</pba-flex>

---

## Benefits of Pre-Funded Model

<pba-flex center>

- Enables sustained high-quality OpenGov participation
- Creates clear expectations for all stakeholders
- Provides appropriate legal protections for contributors
- Recognizes specialized expertise appropriately
- Allows for balanced ecosystem participation
- Improves OpenGov outcomes through consistent quality review

</pba-flex>

---

## Conclusion

<pba-flex center>

Sustainable OpenGov participation requires fundamental changes:

- Securing upfront funding through OpenGov prior to work commencement
- Clear terms for contribution scope and compensation
- Appropriate legal protections secured through budgeting
- Ecosystem-wide professional indemnity and liability insurance
- Recognition of specialized expertise through fair compensation

Pre-funded, formally approved work through OpenGov combined with pooled insurance resources represents a promising sustainable approach for specialized OpenGov contributions, while remaining open to diverse participation models that may emerge from community innovation.
