🫠 ... Is this _supposed_ to be some embedded slides but is an embedded 404 in a valid page?

- If you are _developing_ slides, you must rebuild & serve with `makers s` command, embedded slides are NOT present in the mdBook watching serve 😭.
- If still broken, or you are looking at the hosted or slides - please `suggest an edit` so we can fix it together, pointing to the exact source of the problem.
